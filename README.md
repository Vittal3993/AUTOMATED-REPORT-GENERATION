Company : Codetech IT solutions

Name : Vittal Mallikarjun Mugali

Intern ID : CT06DY1012

Domain : Python Programming

Duration : 6 weeks

Mentor : Neela santosh

Project Description :  

This project focuses on building a Python-based automation tool that reads structured data from external files (e.g., CSV), performs basic analysis, and generates a well-formatted PDF report using the FPDF library. The goal is to streamline reporting workflows by eliminating manual formatting and enabling consistent, data-driven documentation.

Key Features :

Reads tabular data from CSV files using pandas

Computes summary statistics and department-wise aggregations

Generates clean, professional PDF reports with headers, footers, and structured sections

Includes timestamped metadata for traceability

Designed for scalability and integration into larger automation pipelines

Technologies Used : 

Python 3.10+

Pandas for data manipulation

FPDF for PDF generation

Datetime for timestamping

Outcome :

The final deliverable is a reusable Python script that can be adapted for various reporting needsâ€”whether for sensor logs, performance metrics, or business dashboards. It demonstrates proficiency in Python scripting, modular design, and real-world automation.
